READMEFor the movement instruction:	Click 1 botton on the number pad to start/stop hair,        Click 2 botton on the number pad to start/stop mouth,        Click 3 botton on the number pad to start/stop eye        Click left botton to slow the rate of chage for three objects,         Click right botton to accelerate the rate of chage for three objects,         Only when the eyes are fully open, stop the eye, click the frame to move eyeballs.In order to have three statements for eye, I have three classes for eye. The first class is Eye.java and EyeStateTwo.java and EyeStateThree.java inheritate Eye.java.Because first I gave the eyes fixed position and sizes when they are in state one. That why I remain some codes like comments. But they are not comments and I really want to remain them there.Note: only when the eyes are in state one (fully open),user can click frame to move eyeballs. So when the Timer is running, the eyeballs cannot be moved.      When you resize the frame the eyeballs will be a little bit off, that is because we resize it without click the frame.       If you click the frame again the eyeballs will be on the right track.Thank you.
